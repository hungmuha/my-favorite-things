Maximus is the central character of Gladiator. He is a farmer from Spain, who has become Emperor Marcus Aurelius' most trusted general. His hope after finishing off the military campaign against the Germanic tribes is to go home to Spain, but Marcus Aurelius has one more task for him. Marcus Aurelius plans to name Maximus as his heir when he returns to Rome. Maximus tries to decline because he does not like the trappings of power, but Marcus Aurelius asked him as a near son. Maximus had grown close to Marcus Aurelius and thought of him like a father and he couldn't turn him down, especially since he was wary of what would happen if Commodus became Emperor.
